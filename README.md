The program would provide a platform for massage salons and other small businesses to manage their appointments and client information in an organized and efficient manner.

Overview:
The program would provide a platform for massage salons and other small businesses to manage their appointments and client information in an organized and efficient manner.
The program could potentially offer features such as appointment scheduling, client profiles and history, payment processing, and inventory management. The desktop version could be used by salon owners or employees for day-to-day operations, while the Telegram bot could provide clients with a convenient way to book appointments and receive notifications.

Functional requirements:
The program will enable users to schedule appointments and receive notifications related to their appointments. They can also participate in surveys to provide feedback on their experiences and receive information about the services offered and their benefits. Furthermore, users can submit feedback on the services they have received, which will help the service provider improve their offerings and tailor them to the needs of their customers. Overall, these features are designed to enhance the user experience and foster better communication between the user and the service provider.
By using the program, the salon owner can streamline their business operations and reduce the time and effort spent on administrative tasks. The program can also help the salon owner to better manage their clients by organizing their information and history, which can improve the overall customer experience. Additionally, the program provides an additional channel for communication with clients, which can increase engagement and loyalty. Finally, the program's survey and feedback features can help the salon owner to better understand their clients' needs and preferences, which can inform future business decisions and improve their offerings.

Non-functional requirements:
Efficiency: The program should be optimized for performance and productivity, while still being resource-efficient to accommodate small businesses with limited resources.
Security: The program should implement secure user authentication and data encryption to ensure that the client base and user data are protected from unauthorized access.
Access control: The program should provide role-based access control to prevent unauthorized access or modification of client and user data by employees without technical abilities.
By focusing on these non-functional requirements, the program can provide a secure and efficient solution for small businesses while still being easy to use and manage.t is for smalll bisnes so it is didnt take much recurses and hi productivity. but an clients base gonno be secure and it is no easy way for an employers without techical abilities to take oll db. 

System architecture:
The program will consist of three main components: a web application, a Telegram bot, and a Google Calendar integration. The web application will provide an interface for salon owners to manage their appointments, client profiles, and feedback. The Telegram bot will enable clients to schedule appointments, receive notifications, and provide feedback directly from the Telegram app. The Google Calendar integration will allow salon owners to sync their appointments with their Google Calendar, making it easier to manage their schedules.
The system architecture will be built using a combination of programming languages and frameworks, including JavaScript, Node.js, and MongoDB for the web application, and the Telegram Bot API and Google Calendar API for the bot and integration components. The architecture will also include secure user authentication and data encryption to ensure the protection of sensitive data.
Overall, this system architecture will enable salon owners to efficiently manage their appointments and client relationships while providing a seamless and secure user experience.

User interface: 
The main interface for clients would be through the Telegram bot, where they can schedule appointments, receive notifications, participate in surveys, and provide feedback. Clients can also receive information about services and their benefits through the Telegram bot.
As for the salon owners, they would primarily interface using a web application that allows them to manage appointments, client profiles, and feedback. The web application would be accessible through a website, and salon owners would need to log in to access the application.
Additionally, salon owners would also have the option to integrate their appointments with their Google Calendar, which would provide an additional way for them to manage their schedules.
In summary, the main user interface for clients would be through the Telegram bot, while the salon owners would use the web application to manage their appointments, client profiles, and feedback.

Data model:
The data model would need to include the entities for users, clients, appointments, services, and feedback. Here is a brief overview of how these entities could be structured:
User entity: This entity would include information about the system users, such as login credentials, contact information, and access levels.
Client entity: This entity would include information about the clients, such as their name, contact information, preferences, and history of services received.
Appointment entity: This entity would include information about the appointments, such as the date, time, duration, and location of the appointment.
Service entity: This entity would include information about the services provided by the salon, such as the name, description, duration, and price.
Feedback entity: This entity would include information about the feedback provided by the clients, such as the ratings, comments, and suggestions.
The data model would also define the relationships between these entities, such as how clients are associated with their appointments and feedback, and how services are associated with the appointments.
Regarding how user and client data will be stored and accessed, a database management system such as MongoDB could be used to store and manage the data. The system would need to provide secure and reliable access to the data for authorized users, and ensure that the data is organized and easily retrievable. Access to the database could be managed through appropriate authentication and authorization mechanisms.

Testing plan:
Functional testing: This would involve testing the system to ensure that it meets all functional requirements, such as scheduling appointments, sending notifications, receiving feedback, and participating in surveys. This testing could be performed using manual testing methods or automated testing tools, and would need to ensure that all system functions are working as expected.
Non-functional testing: This would involve testing the system to ensure that it meets all non-functional requirements, such as performance, security, and usability. For example, the system should be able to handle a certain number of concurrent users, protect user data from unauthorized access, and provide an easy-to-use interface. This testing could be performed using various tools, such as load testing software, security scanning tools, and usability testing methods.
Integration testing: This would involve testing the system to ensure that it integrates well with third-party systems, such as Telegram and Google Calendar. This testing would need to ensure that the system can communicate with these systems, exchange data as needed, and handle any errors or exceptions that may arise.
User acceptance testing: This would involve testing the system with actual users to ensure that it meets their needs and expectations. This testing could involve soliciting feedback from users, conducting surveys, and observing user interactions with the system.
Regression testing: This would involve testing the system to ensure that changes or updates to the system do not introduce new defects or issues. This testing could be performed using automated testing tools or manual testing methods.
The testing plan would need to define the specific testing strategies, methods, and tools to be used for each type of testing, and specify the testing environment, test data, and test scenarios to be used. It would also need to define the criteria for success, such as the percentage of tests passed, and specify the reporting and documentation requirements. Finally, the testing plan would need to be updated and revised as needed throughout the development and testing process.

Technical stack:
The following technical stack for building the system:
Backend: You could use a Python web framework such as Flask or Django to build the backend of the system.
Database: You could use a relational database such as MySQL or MongoDB
API integration: For integrating with Telegram and Google Calendar, you could use Python libraries such as aiogram and google-api-python-client. 
User interface: For the user interface, you could use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build a website for salon owners to interact with the system. You could use a front-end framework such as Bootstrap or React to make the development process easier.
Testing: For testing the system, you could use Python testing frameworks such as pytest or unittest.

Assumptions and constraints:
The primary issue, in my opinion, is that I developed this program on my own and lacked the necessary proficiency, which makes it time-consuming.
